Arsenite/Arsenate adsorption/desorption example
==================================================

This example models arsenite/arsenate oxidation by
monochloramine, with adsorption of arsenate to the
pipe wall according to the local equilibrium
assumption.  The example network is the simple 4-node
network described in section 3 of the EPANET-MSX user's manual.
The files included are:

  example.inp   --  the EPANET network input file.
  example.msx   --  the MSX reaction file
  example.rpt   --  the report file containing the MSX results
