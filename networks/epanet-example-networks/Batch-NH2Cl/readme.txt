Batch Chloramine Decomposition
==============================

This example models chloramine auto-decomposition to ammonia in
a batch reactor (i.e., a tank connected by a single pipe to a node
with zero demand). The files include:
  batch-nh2cl.inp  -- the EPANET network input file
  batch-nh2cl.msx  -- the MSX reaction input file
  batch-nh2cl.rpt  -- the report file containing the results
  batch-nh2cl.xls  -- an Excel file that compares the MSX results
                      with those from a paper by Vikesland et al.
                      from which the chloramine decay model was taken
